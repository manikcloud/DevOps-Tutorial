# Getting Started

To get started, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. Follow the instructions below:

1. Open a terminal or Git Bash.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```


You have now successfully cloned the repository to your local machine. You can start working on the project and use Git to track your changes.

## Contributing to the Project

Before making any changes, create a new branch based on the master branch. This will help keep the master branch clean and make it easier to collaborate with others.

1. Ensure you are in the `devops-project` directory.
2. Run the following command to create a new branch:

```
git checkout -b your_branch_name
```
3. Make your changes, commit them, and push them to the remote repository:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin your_branch_name
```


When you are ready to merge your changes with the master branch, create a pull request on GitHub. This will allow others to review your changes before merging them.

Remember to always keep your local repository up to date by fetching and merging changes from the remote repository.

Happy coding!
